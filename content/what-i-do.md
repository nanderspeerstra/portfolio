# What I do

After studying linguistics and data science, I’ve been working on projects related to machine translation and speech-to-text applications since 2015. My work involves a mix of tasks, from managing APIs in Python and Node.js to using cloud services like Azure Cloud, Azure DevOps, and Azure Machine Learning.

## Looking further
> There is more than code

I have a passion for coding, but my love for people takes precedence. Over the past few years, I’ve found great joy in mentoring junior colleagues, taking the lead in guiding a team of developers, and fostering collaborations with others.

### LEARN EVERY DAY
I thrive on learning new things, whether it’s staying updated on Python and package versions, exploring new tools, or delving into management courses and detailed company news, including finances. The pursuit of knowledge in all its forms keeps me engaged and intrigued.

### LEAD
Whether it’s guiding a team of people or steering a project, I find my energy in collaboration. I’ve had the experience of being a team lead for a small development team and an unofficial mentor to colleagues in the past. The dynamics of working together fuel my enthusiasm.

### COMMUNICATE
How are you really doing? I genuinely care about people’s feelings and am here to assist with any interpersonal conflicts. I’d love to get to know you better. How about we catch up and share a virtual cup of tea?

### ANALYSE
I have a preference for analyzing situations and processes with the aim of improvement. This means I can be quite critical, but rest assured, I always maintain a professional and kind approach. Having served as a works council member for four years, I enjoy delving into topics and crafting detailed propositions.
