# A short introduction

> A enthusiastic guy with (too) many hobbies

Hello! I'm hailing from Apeldoorn and Twello. My academic journey took me through Linguistics in Nijmegen and then into Data Science in Tilburg. Through the student choir Alphons Diepenbrock, I met my girlfriend, and now we share a cozy home in Ede with our two cats, the adorable hobbits Bilbo and Gilly.

## My Hobbies
Life is too short for all the fun things I want to do, so I have to choose wisely. Here are some of my favorite activities:
- **Making and listening to music**: Whether it's playing the accordion or piano, or indulging in HiRes or vinyl records.
- **Sports**: Cycling and running keep me fit and energized.
- **Tinkering**: From working on our 1977 Classic Mini to fixing up bikes and motorbikes.
- **Collecting**: I'm passionate about my collection of Donald Duck pockets (generation 3).
- **Learning**: Exploring Ruby and Jekyll for this website, which has evolved from Wordpress, to Node.js, to Flask, and pure HTML in its early days.

And did I mention I love photography? Check out some of my shots on the [photography](/photography) page.
